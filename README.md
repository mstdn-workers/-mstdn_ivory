## Usage

#### authorization
For getting access token(and creating app):

```ruby
require 'mstdn_ivory'

client = MstdnIvory::Client.new('baseurl(e.g. https://mstdn-workers.com)')
res = client.create_app('app name',
                        'scopes(e.g. read write follow, default scope is read)',
                        'redirect_uri, default is urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob',
                        'website name, default is nil')
res.client_id # => 'Your client id'
res.client_secret # => 'Your client secret'

auth_url = client.create_authorization_url(res.client_id,
                                          res.client_secret,
                                          'Your client scopes',
                                          'redirect_uri, default is urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob')
auth_url #=> 'https://mstdn-workers.com/oauth/authorize...'

# You got authorization_code in some way
token = client.get_access_token(res.client_id,
                                res.client_secret,
                                'Your authorization code',
                                'redirect_uri, default is urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob')
token #=> 'Your access token'

client.get('/api/v1/accounts/424') # => Information of my accounts(If there is in mstdn-workers.com)
```

If you already have access token, you can easily create client:

```ruby
client = MstdnIvory::Client.new('baseurl', 'Your access token')
client.get('/api/v1/accounts/424') # => Information of my accounts
```

#### examples

You can get, post and stream method using client.

For example, Reading the home timeline:

```ruby
client.get('/api/v1/timelines/home')
```

Post status:
```ruby
client.post('/api/v1/statuses', {'status': 'status content'})
```

Streaming the home timeline([Read](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-the-API/Streaming-API.md) about streaming event and data):
```ruby
client.stream('/api/v1/streaming/user') do |event, data|
  p event
  p data
end
```
